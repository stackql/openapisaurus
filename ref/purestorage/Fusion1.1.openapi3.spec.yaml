  description: >
    Pure Fusion is fully API-driven. Most APIs which change the system (POST, PATCH,
    DELETE) return an Operation in status "Pending" or "Running". You can poll (GET)
    the operation to check its status, waiting for it to change to "Succeeded" or
    "Failed".

tags:
- name: Arrays
  description: (Provider) An Array (Asset) is the physical array. An Array resides
    in an AZ. It has a Hardware Type which is an attribute of the Storage Class.
- name: Availability Zones
  description: An Availability Zone (AZ) (e.g. "NYC DC-1") is a fault domain within
    a Region. It contains Arrays.
- name: Regions
  description: A Region is a collection of Availability Zones. It is owned by AZ Admins.
    Active Cluster / Sync Rep is possible between AZs in the same Region.
- name: Hardware Types
  description: (Provider) A Hardware Type defines a class of hardware (name, array_type,
    media_type). It is used in a creation of Storage Service.
- name: Storage Classes
  description: A Storage Class (e.g. "Gold") is published by the AZ Admin. It is a
    coarse grained tier, perhaps just one per Storage Service and QoS. It specifies
    a Max IOPS / GB, bandwidth and size; as well as Storage Service.
- name: Storage Services
  description: A Storage Service represents a type of storage that shares fundamental
    characteristics like response latency, availability, protocol, and data management
    features. Placement Groups select a Storage service to guarantee consistent snapshots
    and hardware affinity expectations
- name: Protection Policies
  description: A Protection Policy (e.g. "Hourly") is published by the AZ Admin. It
    specifies a Snapshot policy.
- name: Tenants
  description: A Tenant (e.g. "Engineering") is created within an Organization to
    group Tenant Spaces. It enables departments within a company to operate autonomously.
    It is created by an AZ Admin.
- name: Tenant Spaces
  description: A Tenant Space (e.g. "Wiki") contains resources (Volumes, Volume Snapshots,
    etc.) and exists inside a Tenant.
- name: Volumes
  description: A Volume represents a container that manages the storage space on the
    array. After a Volume has been created, establish a Host-Volume connection so
    that the Host can read data from and write data to the Volume. When creating a
    Volume, specify its Storage Class and, optionally, a Protection Policy.
- name: Operations
  description: An Operation is returned from requests which modify state (POST, PATCH,
    DELETE). GET the Operation to see the progress of the request. The resource field
    indicates the resource operated upon; for create (POST), the resource is filled
    in once creation succeeds.
- name: Host Access Policies
  description: Host access policy is assigned to volume to access volume from the
    initiator
- name: Snapshots
  description: A Snapshot contains a grouping of volume snapshots
- name: Volume Snapshots
  description: A Volume Snapshot represents a point in time image of a given Volume.
- name: Placement Groups
  description: A Placement Group contains volumes in the same Tenant Space that reside
    on the same physical array. Volumes inside the same Placement Group could have
    crash-consistent snapshot.
- name: Network Interface Groups
  description: (Provider) A Network Interface Group is a collection of Network Interfaces.
- name: Network Interfaces
  description: (Provider) A Network Interface of an Array for use by Pure Fusion.
- name: Storage Endpoints
  description: (Provider) A Storage Endpoint provides access to storage in an Availability
    Zone.
- name: Identity Manager
  description: An API Client Manager for use by Pure Fusion
- name: Roles
  description: A role confers its permissions to principals (Users or API Clients)
    that are assigned to it.
- name: Role Assignments
  description: A role assignment records that a principal (User or API Client) is
    assigned to a role, scoped to a particular resource and its chidren.
- name: Workload Planner
  description: (Provider) Placement Recommendation APIs that integrates with Pure1
    Meta. Use this if you would like us to tell you where you should be placing/migrating
    your Placement Groups.
